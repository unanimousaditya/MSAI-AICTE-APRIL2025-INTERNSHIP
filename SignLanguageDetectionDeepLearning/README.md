## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/unanimousaditya/MSAI-AICTE-APRIL2025-INTERNSHIP/SignLanguageDetectionDeepLearning.git
   cd AI-sign-language-interpreter
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download pre-trained models**
   ```bash
   python download_models.py
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the web interface**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Allow camera permissions when prompted

## 🎮 Usage

1. **Position your hand** within the camera frame
2. **Perform ASL signs** clearly and steadily
3. **View the interpretation** in real-time on the screen
4. **Adjust settings** using the control panel if needed
5. **Toggle text-to-speech** for audio output of interpreted signs

## 🔄 Training Your Own Model

Want to customize or improve the model? Follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your dataset**

   - Collect sign language images or use our dataset preparation scripts
   - Organize data according to the structure in `/data/README.md`

2. **Configure training parameters**

   ```bash
   nano config/training_config.json
   ```

3. **Run the training script**

   ```bash
   python train.py --config config/training_config.json
   ```

4. **Evaluate the model**
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model_path models/your_new_model.h5
   ```

## 📊 Model Performance

Our current model achieves:

- **95%+ accuracy** on the ASL alphabet
- **90%+ accuracy** on common phrases
- **Real-time processing** at 30+ FPS on modern hardware
